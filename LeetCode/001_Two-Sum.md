# How to approach this problem?

## Brute-Force Approach :
- Time Complexity: *O(N^2)*
- Space Complexity: *O(1)*

**Approach :** Using two loops to find all the pairs that add up to target.

### Step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:
1. Done

## Optimization(Two-Pointer Approach) :
- Time Complexity: *O(N)*
- Space Complexity: *O(N)*

**Approach :** Use the two-pointers approach to find the elements which add up to target.

### Step-by-step explanation of the algorithm:
1. Use the two-pointers approach to find the elements which add up to target.
2. The iterate through the original array to find the index.
3. Then push the index to new resultant array of size two.
