# How to master DSA problem solving skills ?

To improve problem solving skills we have to practice all possible easy problems from every toolbox available. Toolbox means all the concepts available in a particular language to solve any problem. By practising easy problems we will come to know new techniques to solve medium and hard problems. This is a cyclic process as we practice problems problem solving skills will improve and by improving problem solving skills we can practice newer problems of medium and hard difficulties.

> As you know, there is no new problems, all problems are derived from existing problems.

**According to time complexity, from worst to best solution :**
```shell
    O(N^3) < O(N^2) < O(NlogN) < O(N) < O(1)
```

When we solved any problem with any time complexity, we should think can we make it better. For example if we solve any problem with *O(N^2)*, we should think further, can I solve with *O(N)*. By this thinking process we can improve problem solving skills.

**To be more precise, we can follow these steps :**

**Step-1 :** Brute-force solution \
**Step-2 :** Divide into sub-problem \
**Step-3 :** Optimization
- by sorting
- using space
- many more techniques will be known by doing practice...

#### To master problem solving skills we have have to further process even after solving a problem
- go through the solution you have done by yourselves
- go through the solution that is solved by other programmers to learn new things.
- Make notes on how you approach that problem, divide it into steps
- Then, finally upload on GitHub because you may need it in future for reference, this also improve your self confidence which is needed to solve better problems.

## Optimization Techniques:
- by sorting
- using space
- by using two pointers


That's all. Thanks for reading.
